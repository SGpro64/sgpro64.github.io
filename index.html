          <h2>About The Kingdom</h2>
          <p class="Description">
            The image of Colchis as a fabulous land of gold and magic endured
            for a long time. Many scholars thought that Colchis was already a
            powerful kingdom in the second millennium B.C., and the myth of the
            Argonauts actually described a historical expedition of the Greeks
            to the eastern shores of the Black Sea. Clearly, we should be
            cautious to trust ancient myths and legends, but we can trust
            archeology. And archeology has achieved much in investigating the
            distant past of western Georgia. Archeologists discovered numerous
            burial sites dating back to the second millennium B.C. possessing
            abundant agricultural artifacts. The countless agricultural tools
            puzzled the specialists who studied these burial sites. These
            archeological discoveries revealed highly developed agriculture and
            population growth in western Georgia during the second half of the
            second millennium B.C. As the excavations revealed, the ancestors of
            modern Georgians lived in wooden houses encircled by wooden walls
            and water-canals. They jointly cultivated the land. The collective
            effort in land-cultivation was always essential in the boggy lands
            of these areas especially in the lowlands of western Georgia, which
            were always covered by dense forests and swampland (only the great
            labors organized by the Soviet government during the 1920-30s made
            it possible to drain this territory of swamp). It seems that during
            one thousand years the life-style of the inhabitants of western
            Georgia did not change that much. Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine,
            Turkish and European travelers described the western Georgian
            population as living in the forests in wooden cabins and towers
            hidden from outsiders eyes (this lifestyle survived into the first
            half of the twentieth century).
